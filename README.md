# Get all combinations of digits from a string

### All you have to do is to run:

```
node index.js
```

I have this solution that I think it is interesting!

On line 12 you have a nice replace() **:D**

This solution works for you requirements exactly.

If you want I could work on it and make it dynamic to work for 2 characters or 5 etc. I would love to do that but If this is enough to have a talk that would be great. :)

I can't wait to see what you think!

This was an awesome challenge :)
